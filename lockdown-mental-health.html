            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to various psychological problems like depression, anxiety, and panic disorder, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe threats to the lives and physical health of people around the globe. (Qiu et al., 2020). Public health strategies such as isolation, reduced social contact, and hygiene practices have helped reduce infections but also increased mental health issues like anxiety and depression. (Zhou et al., 2020).
            </p>
            <p>
                It is crucial for governments, hospitals, educational institutions, and individuals to provide psychological interventions to address mental health challenges during such stressful situations. This study aims to understand and address the psychological impact of the lockdown.

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                This survey involved 440 participants from 18 countries, 32 states, and 112 cities. The survey explored various factors impacting health, such as sleep, food, exercise, stress, and relationships. Data was collected via a Google form and analyzed using Tableau, creating 22 worksheets, 3 dashboards, and 1 storyline.

            <p>
                The survey ensured anonymity to encourage honest responses. Responses were converted into CSV format and visualized in Tableau for interactive analysis.
