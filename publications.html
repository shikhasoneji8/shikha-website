              In general, Terms of Service (ToS) and other policy documents are verbose and full of legal jargon, which poses challenges for users to understand. To improve user accessibility and transparency, the "Terms of Service; Didn't Read" (ToS;DR) project condenses intricate legal terminology into summaries and overall grades for the website's policy documents. Nevertheless, uncertainties remain about whether users could truly grasp the implications of simplified presentations. We conducted an online survey to assess the perceived understandability and severity of randomly chosen cases from the ToS;DR taxonomy. Preliminary results indicate that, although most users report understanding the cases, they find a bias towards service providers in about two-thirds of the cases. The findings of our study emphasize the necessity of prioritizing user-centric policy formulation. This study has the potential to reveal the extent of information imbalance in digital services and promote more well-informed user consent.

              The complexities of legalese in terms and policy documents can bind individuals to contracts they do not fully
              comprehend, potentially leading to uninformed data sharing. This work addresses that challenge by developing language
              models capable of producing automated, accessible summaries and scores for such documents, improving user
              understanding and enabling informed decision-making.  
              We compared transformer-based and conventional models using our dataset, with RoBERTa achieving the highest
              performance at an F1-score of 0.74. Using this best-performing model, we detected redundancies and potential
              guideline violations by identifying overlaps in GDPR-required documents, emphasizing the need for stronger GDPR
              compliance.

              Terms of service (ToS) documents provide guidelines that users must follow to utilize a company’s services. Although
              posting ToS is not always legally required, certain regulations mandate it in specific cases. Users are expected to
              read and understand these terms before using a service — yet the familiar checkbox of “Yes, I have read and agree”
              is often called the “biggest lie on the internet.” ToS documents are typically lengthy and complex, making them
              difficult for users to read. Research shows participants spent an average of 51 seconds reading a ToS that should
              take 15–17 minutes to read thoroughly, with information overload being a key factor.  
              This work uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Explainable AI (XAI) to create a browser
              extension that automatically simplifies and categorizes complex documents like privacy policies, producing summarized
              and annotated versions for faster comprehension. By bridging the knowledge gap, this technology empowers users to
              make informed decisions, improves digital consent transparency, builds trust, and ensures that terms are truly
              understood and agreeable.

              The Helix project is a multiyear longitudinal research study focused on understanding what makes systems engineers
              effective. Data were gathered through interviews, site visits, and surveys with individuals performing systems
              engineering (SE) work, supervising systems engineers, using SE products, or otherwise knowledgeable about SE.
              Responses were documented and analyzed using text mining techniques such as topic modeling and word similarity.
              The results were interpreted through visualizations generated for three scenarios: full corpus, by organization type,
              and by domain. These visuals reveal the common language among systems engineers within topics and the relationships
              between words in the three scenarios. The article also offers insights into the factors that enable systems engineers
              to be proficient and effective.

            Assessing an AI system's behavior-particularly in Explainable AI Systems-is sometimes done empirically, by measuring people's abilities to predict the agent's next move-but how to perform such measurements? In empirical studies with humans, an obvious approach is to frame the task as binary (i.e., prediction is either right or wrong), but this does not scale. As output spaces increase, so do floor effects, because the ratio of right answers to wrong answers quickly becomes very small. The crux of the problem is that the binary framing is failing to capture the nuances of the different degrees of "wrongness." To address this, we begin by proposing three mathematical bases upon which to measure "partial wrongness." We then uses these bases to perform two analyses on sequential decision-making domains: the first is an in-lab study with 86 participants on a size-36 action space; the second is a re-analysis of a prior study on a size-4 action space. Other researchers adopting our operationalization of the prediction task and analysis methodology will improve the rigor of user studies conducted with that task, which is particularly important when the domain features a large output space.

              There is significant interest in the DoD, as well as in Congress, in ensuring that DoD can characterize and
              manage its systems engineering (SE) workforce. Establishing a baseline understanding of the SE workforce is essential
              for measuring the impact of SERC and other DoD human capital initiatives, including recruitment and retention
              programs. This research aims to answer one primary research question—how organizations can improve the effectiveness
              of their SE workforce—supported by three sub-questions focused on impact, critical enabling factors, and shifts
              needed for different SE approaches.  
              In 2018, the Helix team engaged seven new organizations and added over 100 interviewees to the dataset, bringing
              total participation to 464 individuals and 29 organizations, supplemented by consultant interviews. Results inform

              The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have faced persistent systems engineering
              challenges in recent years. Launched in 2012, the Helix project is a multi-year longitudinal research study focused on

              In 2018, the scope expanded beyond workforce focus to include how organizations can strengthen systems engineering as

              Cloud computing enables both storage and sharing of data at scale, but raises critical concerns over 
              data integrity and security during sharing. Verifying integrity and consistency of stored cloud data 
              is challenging for both the user and the cloud server. Public Auditing methods address this by allowing
